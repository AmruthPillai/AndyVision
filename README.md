<b>The solution to reading whatâ€™s not on your screen!</b>

## Introduction

An Android Application that will allow you to identify the text seen from your phone camera using <a href="https://developers.google.com/vision/">Google's Mobile Vision API</a>.  

Using <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Google's Firebase</a>, I hope to demonstrate it's Authentication, Storage, and Realtime Database features to allow each individual authorized user to store images of his scanned documents and also an OCR result of the same for future use.  

Using <a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech/">Google's Speech API</a> that's included in most Android phones these days, I try to read out the text scanned from the document out loud for the end user, in an easy seamless manner.

<i>Perfect for those moments when you want to just run a mile and listen to what your boring history textbook has to say.</i>
